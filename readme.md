# Reinforcement Learning for Board Games



This repository demonstrates a project that develops reinforcement learning (RL) agents for strategic board games (e.g., Catan and Monopoly). The project implements:
- **DQN (Deep Q-Network)** for value-based decision making.
- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** for policy-gradient based learning.

The agents are trained on thousands of simulated gameplays generated by custom environments. Reward shaping techniques are applied to enhance training stability and accelerate convergence.

## Repository Structure
- **environments/**: Contains custom board game environments (simplified versions of Catan and Monopoly) with a Gym-like interface.
- **agents/**: Contains implementations for the DQN and PPO agents.
- **training/**: Scripts to train the agents.
- **experiments/**: Configuration files for experiments.
- **utils/**: Utility functions for replay buffers, logging, and reward shaping.
- **datasets/**: A placeholder and instructions for generating/sourcing datasets.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reinforcement-learning-board-games.git
    cd reinforcement-learning-board-games
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Experiments

### Train DQN Agent
```bash
python training/train_dqn.py --env monopoly --config experiments/config_dqn.yaml
```
### Train PPO Agent
```bash
python training/train_ppo.py --env catan --config experiments/config_ppo.yaml
```

### Dataset
Since no comprehensive public dataset exists for board games like Catan or Monopoly, the repository includes code to simulate gameplays and record trajectories. Please see datasets/README.md for instructions on generating your dataset.
